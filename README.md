# Kingpin: Life of Crime internal cheat

This is a fully-featured Kingpin clienthook, which was written out of boredom while I was thinking of replaying the game.

**This cheat DOES NOT work online!**
I didn't really bother myself with taking a look at how the game works online, since if you're playing online, the game doesn't load gamex86.dll, which is the reason why cheat doesn't work in multiplayer.

### This cheat includes:
+ Aimbot
+ Silent Aimbot
+ Classic Wallhack
+ Chams (kinda broken atm)
+ ESP
+ God Mode
+ Infinite Ammo
+ Infinite Armor
+ Rapid Fire
+ Speedhack
+ Change pellet amount per shot for shotgun
+ Change bullet type for bullet-based weapons (Pistol, Tommy, HMG start shooting BFG projectiles, hyperblaster cells or railgun slugs)
+ Bunnyhop

**This cheat works with both GoG and Steam versions of Kingpin!!**

***If you want to use debugger for some reason and you're running Steam version of the game, make sure you use Steamless on kingpin.exe first, or else debugger won't catch shit due to Steam DRM's anti-debugger***

The addresses are pretty much the same.
